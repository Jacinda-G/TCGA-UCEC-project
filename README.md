# TCGA-UCEC-project
Image processing project for the TCGA-UCEC dataset focusing on endometrial carcinoma
The TCGA-UCEC dataset comprises of images for 65 patients with endometrial carcinoma. Data was obtained from the cancer imaging archive: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19039602.
Over 75k images from CT, CR, MR, PT modalities were obtained for this dataset. Genomic data can be found at https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/exploration?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.project_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA-UCEC%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D. 
The purpose of this project is to link known genomic data from the patients in this study to image data to see if gene mutation plays a role in carcinoma stages and imaging.
